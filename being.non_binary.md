Being.non_binary is a monologue about gender expression, stories collected from peopleâ€™s experiences of coming and identifying as non-binary. Dissembling the binary system is one of the main topics of my podcast, involes stories about everyday incidents, that non-binary people have to live with. My goal was to create an inclusive space for anyone who would like to learn about this topic, because, in a way, it is still neglected in our society.
